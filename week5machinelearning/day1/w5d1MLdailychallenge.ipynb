In healthcare, for example, a doctor might not be able to work such long hours and remember all the numbers of a lot of patience, but machine learning can create patterns and give predictions with clear visualizations. In model evaluation, recall(sensitivity) is the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified, so in cases like cancer diagnosis, which is when the cost of a false nagative is high, meaning missing a positive case can be very dangerous, is a good example.\n",

For example, banks and fintech companies use ML algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness by analyzing historical data like income, debt history, repayment behavior, and credit history to predict loan default risk. Machine gives faster, more accurate loan approvals and risk-based interest rates.\n",
