suggestions for improvement:
- **Exercise 4:** The random number generation should be inside the function.  Currently, `dice1` is generated outside the function, making the function's behavior dependent on external state. The function should generate its own random number each time it is called.  Add input validation to ensure the user enters a number between 1 and 100.
- **Exercise 6:** The `make_great` function creates a new list instead of modifying the original list in place, as instructed.  It should modify `magician_names` directly.
- **Exercise 7:** The `main` function should take the temperature as a parameter rather than relying on a global variable. This improves modularity and testability.  The bonus features (floating-point temperatures and seasonal adjustments) are not implemented.
Brief justification:
- correctness: Most exercises are implemented correctly, fulfilling the core requirements.  Exercise 4 needs improvement as the random number is generated outside its function. Exercise 6 does not modify the original list as specified. Exercise 7 lacks the bonus features and uses global variables where parameters would be better.  The minor issues prevent a perfect score.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is well-structured.  The use of f-strings enhances readability.
- performance: The code is efficient, with no noticeable performance bottlenecks. The algorithms are straightforward and optimized for the given tasks.
- security: No security vulnerabilities were identified. The code does not interact with external systems or handle user input in a way that could introduce security risks.
